# Online Marketplace System for Buying and Selling New and Used Products

## 📌 Project Overview
The Online Marketplace System for Buying and Selling New and Used Products is a web-based application developed to provide a digital platform where users can easily buy and sell products online.

This system allows sellers to post advertisements for both new and used products, while buyers can browse listings, view detailed product information, and communicate with sellers. Products are organized into categories and subcategories to improve search and navigation.

The platform includes an administrator module responsible for managing users, approving advertisements, and maintaining system security. Online payment functionality enables safe and convenient transactions, allowing users to complete purchases anytime and from anywhere.

The project is designed mainly for academic and learning purposes, and additional advanced features can be implemented in the future once the core system is fully functional.
